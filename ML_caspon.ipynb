An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage, illness, or death in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this guarantee. For example, you may pay a premium of Rs. 5000 each year for a health insurance cover of Rs. 200,000/- so that if, God forbid, you fall ill and need to be hospitalised in that year, the insurance provider company will bear the cost of hospitalisation etc. for upto Rs. 200,000. Now if you are wondering how can company bear such high hospitalisation cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 5000/-, that is where the concept of probabilities comes in picture. For example, like you, there may be 100 customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 5000 every year, but only a few of them (say 2-3) would get hospitalised that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.\n","\n","Just like medical insurance, there is vehicle insurance where every year customer needs to pay a premium of certain amount to insurance provider company so that in case of unfortunate accident by the vehicle, the insurance provider company will provide a compensation (called â€˜sum assuredâ€™) to the customer.\n","\n","Building a model to predict whether a customer would be interested in Vehicle Insurance is extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.\n","\n","Now, in order to predict, whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance, you have information about demographics (gender, age, region code type), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policy (Premium, sourcing channel) etc.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"JqDqNw9rmmU_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Let's Begin**"],"metadata":{"id":"Pt-9osv_-6LU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##**1.Know your data**"],"metadata":{"id":"Niv_xzeqq2vV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","**Import Libraries**\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"B46nUFHQqwyr"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, roc_auc_score\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV"],"metadata":{"id":"VSKHcBfylh_8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"9ia4TLCCivX-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Dataset Loading**"],"metadata":{"id":"0GPDZvKOr2oB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Load data set\n","df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Project/ML/capson/TRAIN-HEALTH INSURANCE CROSS SELL PREDICTION.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"QchwcdDwlhu1"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Dataset First View**"],"metadata":{"id":"linv_PTFsa-g"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"bSR1nsnelhqU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Dataset Rows & Columns count**"],"metadata":{"id":"AOgtvOp1sytt"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.shape"],"metadata":{"id":"AWiAeKwdlhl4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Data Information**"],"metadata":{"id":"bc2bQI4tuRpt"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.info()"],"metadata":{"id":"rDTi_tzslhd4"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Duplicate Values**"],"metadata":{"id":"-SawyJ_Qu5Hn"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"kzmstjD8U4GI"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Dataset Duplicate Value Count\n","df.duplicated().sum()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Missing Values/Null Values**"],"metadata":{"id":"vsP-wEhxvh2O"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Missing Values/Null Values Count\n","df.isnull().sum()"],"metadata":{"id":"Zy38Y0F6vjrO"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Visualizing the missing values\n","# Checking Null Value by plotting Heatmap\n","sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cbar= False)"],"metadata":{"id":"fz72PM0Gvs74"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**What did you know about your dataset?**"],"metadata":{"id":"csKuvM7G59xk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This dataset is provided by an insurance company to help build a model that predicts whether past health insurance policyholders would be interested in purchasing vehicle insurance.
